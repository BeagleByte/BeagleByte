Snyk is a security tool that helps developers find and fix vulnerabilities in their open-source dependencies, container images, and infrastructure as code. The Snyk plugin for JetBrains IDE`s can installed over Settings->Plugins.

### Key Features of the Snyk Plugin for IntelliJ:

After that you have access to the vulnerability scanner, which is very useful. I use it for my own projects, especially for python (due to a lot of dependencies). This make it easy to find in the third party libraries vulnerabilities. 
I also use it for Hack the Box challenges, for instance the Web challenges often providing source code and it makes it easier to find the clue to solve the Lab.
